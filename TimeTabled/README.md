For this project, I created a one-week calendar that includes one-hour time blocks to plan events dynamically. The calendar is designed to display different events with unique titles and colors based on their type.

I explored different approaches to structuring and styling the calendar, including:
Using React components to build a flexible and reusable schedule
Implementing props to pass event details dynamically
Applying conditional styling to differentiate event types by color
Structuring the layout with HTML table elements.
